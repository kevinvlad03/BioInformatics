#The melting temp is the temp at which one half of a particular DNA will disociate and become a single strand of DNA primerland and sequences are of critical importance in designing the parameters of a successful amplification. The tm of a nucleic acid duplex increases both with its length and with increasing GC content. tm=4(G+C)+2(A+T). Implement an app that computes the tm of a DNA sequence by using one of the formula or both of them. Input = a string of DNA, Output = temp in Celsius.
